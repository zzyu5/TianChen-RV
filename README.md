# TianChen-RV MLIR

TianChen-RV MLIR is a capability-driven execution layer for extensible RISC-V AI kernels after high-level MLIR. It does not introduce a new high-level tensor or tile IR; it organizes target capabilities, extension plugins, execution variants, legality, dispatch, lowering, and fallback.

## Project Spine

```text
High-level MLIR op
  -> target capability model
  -> extension plugin registry
  -> plugin-proposed execution variants
  -> legality verification
  -> capability-aware variant selection / dispatch
  -> plugin-owned lowering / emission / runtime glue
  -> RVV / IME / offload / fallback executable path
```

## Current Bootstrap

This repository is bootstrapped as a conventional MLIR project:

```text
include/TianChenRV/
lib/
tools/tcrv-opt/
test/
cmake/
CMakeLists.txt
```

The first compiler slice defines a minimal `tcrv.exec.*` operation family through TableGen/ODS and C++ registration. MLIR registers the concrete namespace as `tcrv` so operations parse and print as `tcrv.exec.kernel`, `tcrv.exec.variant`, and related core execution ops. The family is intentionally limited to execution organization concepts such as kernels, targets, capabilities, variants, dispatch, and fallback. Concrete computation belongs in extension dialects such as `tcrv.rvv`, `tcrv.ime`, `tcrv.offload`, or future plugin-local dialects.

The built-in RVV first slice registers the concrete MLIR namespace
`tcrv_rvv` through the RVV plugin path. It includes metadata/control-plane
surfaces such as `!tcrv_rvv.vl`, `#tcrv_rvv.policy`, and
`tcrv_rvv.lowering_boundary` for selected RVV variants. The lowering boundary
is pre-executable compiler metadata only: it does not emit RVV intrinsics,
lower to LLVM/RISC-V, create runtime ABI glue, generate objects, run hardware,
prove correctness, or measure performance.

Selected-path lowering-boundary materialization is routed through the generic
extension plugin registry. The public `tcrv-opt` pass
`--tcrv-materialize-selected-lowering-boundaries` delegates selected direct,
dispatch-case, and dispatch-fallback variant references to their origin plugin.
RVV is the first materializing implementation; scalar fallback is a valid
metadata-only no-boundary response.

## Build

Configure with an installed LLVM/MLIR package:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja \
  -DLLVM_DIR=/usr/lib/llvm-20/lib/cmake/llvm \
  -DMLIR_DIR=/usr/lib/llvm-20/lib/cmake/mlir
cmake --build build
```

If LLVM/MLIR CMake packages or required tools are missing, configuration fails with an explicit diagnostic. The project must not replace MLIR compiler internals with Python data structures.

## Test

Run lit/FileCheck tests after building:

```bash
cmake --build build --target check-tianchenrv
```

Python is used only for support tooling such as lit configuration, runners, probes, supervision scripts, and artifact parsing. Core IR, dialects, operations, passes, plugin registries, capability models, lowering, and emission belong in C++ / MLIR / LLVM / TableGen / CMake.

## Hardware Evidence

The current real hardware mainline is RVV 1.0 via `ssh rvv`. Any RVV correctness, runtime, or performance claim must include real `ssh rvv` evidence. Local CMake, `tcrv-opt`, or lit checks are compiler/toolchain evidence only.

Use the bounded RVV probe to record hardware/toolchain availability without
claiming TianChen-RV compiler lowering or runtime support:

```bash
python3 scripts/rvv_remote_probe.py
```

The probe writes sanitized JSON evidence and command logs under
`artifacts/tmp/rvv_probe/<run-id>/`. Its tiny RVV intrinsic compile/run check
only proves remote RVV header/toolchain/program availability; it is not a
TianChen-RV-generated executable, correctness result, or performance result.
The JSON also exposes sanitized `capability_facts` for the plugin-local C++
RVV capability profile; Python remains evidence/artifact tooling and is not the
compiler capability model.

## Scalar Fallback First Slice

The built-in plugin registry also includes a C++ `scalar-plugin` first slice.
It proposes `@scalar_fallback_first_slice` only when the target kernel declares
an available structured capability `scalar.fallback`, and it participates in
the same legality, cost, selection, emission-readiness, and emission-plan
interfaces as other plugins.

This scalar fallback path is compiler metadata for a portable fallback route.
It marks a generic conservative fallback role for dispatch synthesis and emits
metadata-only readiness/plan diagnostics. It does not add a new high-level
compute op, emit executable code, prove correctness, or measure performance in
this slice.
