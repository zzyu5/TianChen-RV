# MLIR Testing Contract

## Required Test Forms

TianChen-RV MLIR compiler behavior must be tested through the standard MLIR/LLVM stack:

```text
lit
FileCheck
C++ tests where appropriate
CMake configure/build checks
```

## lit / FileCheck

Use lit/FileCheck for:

- dialect syntax;
- parser/printer round trips;
- operation verification;
- expected verifier diagnostics;
- pass pipelines;
- rewrite/lowering behavior visible in textual IR;
- capability-driven variant generation and rejection diagnostics;
- dispatch/fallback IR structure;
- default public pass diagnostics when origin plugins are not registered.
- emission-plan diagnostic verifier behavior and default public
  materialization-pass diagnostics when origin plugins are not registered.
- public tool built-in plugin routing, including `tcrv-opt` RVV first-slice
  unsupported readiness/plan diagnostics, unknown-origin diagnostics, selected
  marker traversal, dispatch case/fallback ordering, and
  `--tcrv-disable-builtin-plugins` negative coverage for empty-registry plugin
  dialect behavior.

Example test intent:

```text
RUN: tcrv-opt %s --verify-diagnostics --tcrv-some-pass | FileCheck %s
```

The exact tool name may evolve, but the test must exercise real MLIR tools or project MLIR tools, not Python pseudo-IR.

## C++ Tests

Use C++ tests for:

- plugin registry APIs;
- capability query helper semantics;
- cost model helper logic;
- concrete first-slice plugin registration, proposal metadata, legality, and
  registry-backed selection consumption;
- built-in plugin registration helpers, including safe registration lifetime,
  lookup-visible plugin names/origins, and deterministic duplicate handling;
- registry-injected pass behavior that requires in-process mock plugins;
- non-textual MLIR interfaces;
- C++ utility behavior that is not well covered through textual IR.
- emission-plan materialization helpers that need injected mock registries,
  deterministic selected-path ordering checks, no-partial-mutation checks, and
  unsupported first-slice plugin behavior.

## CMake Checks

Every compiler component should be included in CMake ownership:

- dialect libraries;
- pass libraries;
- plugin libraries;
- command-line tools;
- lit test suites;
- C++ unit tests where present.

At minimum, validation for compiler changes should include CMake configure/build checks or a clear report that the local MLIR/LLVM toolchain is unavailable.

## RVV Evidence

RVV runtime, correctness, and performance claims require real `ssh rvv` evidence.

Acceptable evidence examples:

```text
ssh rvv probe output showing host/arch/core/toolchain facts
remote compile/run logs from the RVV machine
remote correctness output with input/profile metadata
remote performance output with command, target profile, and selected variant
```

Not acceptable as RVV runtime evidence:

```text
local compile-only check
local markdown/spec review
Python-only smoke test
mocked probe output
unattributed artifact copied from an older run
```

## Python Tool Tests

Python tooling may have Python tests, shell smoke tests, or script-level checks. These only validate tooling. They cannot be used as the sole evidence for MLIR dialects, passes, capability decisions, lowering, or emission.
