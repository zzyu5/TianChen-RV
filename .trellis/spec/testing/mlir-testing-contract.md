# MLIR Testing Contract

## Required Test Forms

TianChen-RV MLIR compiler behavior must be tested through the standard MLIR/LLVM stack:

```text
lit
FileCheck
C++ tests where appropriate
CMake configure/build checks
```

## lit / FileCheck

Use lit/FileCheck for:

- dialect syntax;
- parser/printer round trips;
- operation verification;
- expected verifier diagnostics;
- pass pipelines;
- rewrite/lowering behavior visible in textual IR;
- capability-driven variant generation and rejection diagnostics;
- public plugin-variant materialization pass behavior, including built-in
  registry proposal routing, deterministic proposal order, parseable downstream
  pass pipelines, no-built-in-registry diagnostics, plugin-local proposal
  recoverable declines, fatal malformed proposal failures, no-viable-proposals
  diagnostics, fallback preservation after extension-local evidence declines,
  and safe repeated-run behavior;
- dispatch/fallback IR structure;
- default public pass diagnostics when origin plugins are not registered.
- emission-plan diagnostic verifier behavior and default public
  materialization-pass diagnostics when origin plugins are not registered.
- public tool built-in plugin routing, including `tcrv-opt` RVV first-slice
  unsupported readiness/plan diagnostics, unknown-origin diagnostics, selected
  marker traversal, dispatch case/fallback ordering, and
  `--tcrv-disable-builtin-plugins` negative coverage for empty-registry plugin
  dialect behavior.
- generic selected lowering-boundary pass routing, RVV lowering-boundary syntax,
  scalar fallback lowering-boundary syntax, verifier diagnostics, selected
  dispatch-case materialization, scalar fallback preservation, scalar-only
  metadata-boundary behavior, missing selected-surface diagnostics, old RVV pass
  compatibility, and unsupported RVV evidence wording.
- public `--tcrv-execution-planning-pipeline` coverage through `tcrv-opt`,
  including deterministic built-in RVV/scalar proposal order, selected
  dispatch/fallback materialization, selected lowering-boundary metadata,
  boundary-linked emission-plan diagnostics, parseable pipeline output,
  fallback preservation after recoverable RVV proposal declines,
  no-viable-proposal diagnostics, pre-existing mismatched variant diagnostics,
  deterministic rerun diagnostics, and fatal invalid selected RVV metadata.
- boundary-aware emission planning diagnostics, including missing selected
  boundary, selected-boundary origin mismatch, selected-variant mismatch, stale
  boundary after selection changes, duplicate competing boundaries,
  required-capability mismatch, and no diagnostic append after failed
  materialization.
- plugin-owned runtime ABI/emission ownership metadata on materialized emission
  plans, including bounded runtime ABI kind/name, runtime glue role, required
  capability refs, unsupported RVV metadata boundaries, scalar metadata-only
  fallback routes, and malformed plugin-returned metadata rejection.
- target/export emission handoff manifests, including public tool coverage,
  deterministic symbol/path ordering, scalar fallback metadata-only selected
  paths, unsupported/deferred RVV emission metadata, pipeline-to-export
  coverage, and negative tests proving invalid selected surfaces or malformed
  runtime ABI ownership metadata produce no manifest.
- RVV smoke-probe C target export, including pipeline-to-export coverage,
  deterministic multi-kernel ordering, selected RVV kernel/variant/march
  comments, `riscv_vector.h` use, fail-before-source diagnostics for malformed
  selected RVV metadata, and no manifest/runtime-success/raw-log/performance
  claims.
- RVV explicit microkernel C target export, including dialect parse/verify for
  `tcrv_rvv.i32_vadd_microkernel`, post-planning or boundary-materialized
  pipeline-to-export coverage, selected kernel/variant/march comments,
  `riscv_vector.h` use, RVV i32 load/add/store intrinsics, self-checking
  `main`, fail-before-source diagnostics for missing selected RVV paths,
  missing/stale boundaries, missing/duplicate microkernel ops, malformed
  selected march metadata, and no manifest/runtime-success/raw-log/performance
  numbers.
- RVV explicit microkernel emission-plan and emission-manifest handoff,
  including supported standalone C source export metadata only when a selected
  RVV path has exactly one matching `tcrv_rvv.i32_vadd_microkernel`, manifest
  serialization of the bounded handoff fields, stale/duplicate microkernel
  diagnostics, and tests proving the microkernel attachment is not counted as a
  duplicate selected lowering boundary.
- generic target source artifact export routing, including post-planning
  selected-path/emission-plan consumption, deterministic agreement with the
  direct RVV microkernel C exporter for the checked-in explicit microkernel
  fixture, fail-closed diagnostics for unsupported metadata-only paths, missing
  plan/route metadata, unknown route ids, unsupported artifact kinds, stale
  selected paths, missing lowering boundaries, missing microkernels, ambiguous
  multiple supported artifacts, and scalar/offload paths not being routed
  through the RVV exporter.

Example test intent:

```text
RUN: tcrv-opt %s --verify-diagnostics --tcrv-some-pass | FileCheck %s
```

The exact tool name may evolve, but the test must exercise real MLIR tools or project MLIR tools, not Python pseudo-IR.

## C++ Tests

Use C++ tests for:

- plugin registry APIs;
- capability query helper semantics;
- plugin-local RVV capability-profile validation, including positive sanitized
  probe facts, missing vector hints, non-`riscv64` architecture, compile/run
  failure, missing clang/CMake availability, deterministic sanitized capability
  identities, and preservation of unsupported RVV emission readiness/plans;
- cost model helper logic;
- concrete first-slice plugin registration, proposal metadata, legality, and
  registry-backed selection consumption;
- built-in plugin registration helpers, including safe registration lifetime,
  lookup-visible plugin names/origins, and deterministic duplicate handling;
- registry-injected pass behavior that requires in-process mock plugins;
- non-textual MLIR interfaces;
- C++ utility behavior that is not well covered through textual IR.
- emission-plan materialization helpers that need injected mock registries,
  deterministic selected-path ordering checks, no-partial-mutation checks, and
  unsupported first-slice plugin behavior.
- selected lowering-boundary materialization helpers that need an in-process
  registry, origin routing, disabled or unknown plugin diagnostics, malformed
  selected-path rejection, plugin result mismatch checks, RVV
  dispatch-case/direct-marker coverage, scalar fallback preservation, malformed
  RVV legality rejection, and bounded unsupported emission-plan status checks.
- plugin-local scalar fallback validation, including proposal gating on an
  available `scalar.fallback` capability, materialization, legality rejection
  for missing/unavailable fallback capability, conservative cost metadata,
  generic conservative fallback role metadata, metadata-only emission readiness,
  and stable non-executable emission-plan fields.

## CMake Checks

Every compiler component should be included in CMake ownership:

- dialect libraries;
- pass libraries;
- plugin libraries;
- command-line tools;
- lit test suites;
- C++ unit tests where present.

At minimum, validation for compiler changes should include CMake configure/build checks or a clear report that the local MLIR/LLVM toolchain is unavailable.

## RVV Evidence

RVV runtime, correctness, and performance claims require real `ssh rvv` evidence.

Acceptable evidence examples:

```text
ssh rvv probe output showing host/arch/core/toolchain facts
remote compile/run logs from the RVV machine
remote correctness output with input/profile metadata
remote performance output with command, target profile, and selected variant
```

Not acceptable as RVV runtime evidence:

```text
local compile-only check
local markdown/spec review
Python-only smoke test
mocked probe output
unattributed artifact copied from an older run
```

## Python Tool Tests

Python tooling may have Python tests, shell smoke tests, or script-level checks. These only validate tooling. They cannot be used as the sole evidence for MLIR dialects, passes, capability decisions, lowering, or emission.

The RVV remote probe must keep a local self-test path that requires no
hardware:

```text
python3 scripts/rvv_remote_probe.py --self-test
```

`check-tianchenrv` should cover that self-test through lit so parser, schema,
and sanitizer behavior are guarded without depending on `ssh rvv`. Passing this
local self-test proves only the Python evidence tooling contract; it is not RVV
runtime, correctness, performance, lowering, or emission evidence. The self-test
must validate the sanitized `capability_facts` artifact section and redaction
behavior, but compiler-facing capability mapping remains covered by C++ plugin
tests rather than Python.

If the repository provides an RVV probe replay helper, it must also be tested as
Python tooling and as MLIR pipeline input. Required coverage:

- a sanitized probe fixture converts to parseable `tcrv.exec` MLIR capability
  ops with the field names consumed by `RVVExtensionPlugin`;
- the replayed MLIR can drive `tcrv-opt --tcrv-execution-planning-pipeline` to
  materialize RVV proposal metadata, selected lowering-boundary metadata, and
  boundary-linked emission-plan diagnostics when the required RVV facts are
  present;
- missing, malformed, failed, secret-like, or unbounded probe facts do not
  invent RVV support;
- scalar fallback remains available when an explicit `scalar.fallback`
  capability is included and RVV evidence is unavailable or declined;
- helper tests must not use raw credentials, private keys, tokens, unbounded
  command dumps, correctness claims, runtime claims, or performance claims.

If the repository exports generated RVV smoke-probe C from post-planning MLIR,
local lit tests must cover the exporter without requiring `ssh rvv`. Any remote
compile/run of that generated source must be reported separately as
hardware/toolchain evidence only, with bounded sanitized artifacts under
`artifacts/tmp/...`; it cannot be used as a TianChen-RV kernel correctness,
supported RVV emission, runtime ABI, or performance result.

If the repository exports generated C for an explicit
`tcrv_rvv.i32_vadd_microkernel`, local lit tests must cover the dialect op and
exporter without requiring `ssh rvv`. Any remote compile/run of that generated
source must be reported separately as bounded microkernel correctness evidence
only for that explicit source and selected flags. It must not be reported as
generic TianChen-RV lowering correctness, arbitrary RVV emission support,
runtime ABI support, or performance evidence.

If the repository provides an end-to-end helper for that explicit microkernel
route, it remains Python runner/evidence tooling only. Local lit coverage must
exercise the helper without contacting `ssh rvv`, including manifest handoff
recognition, deterministic command-summary/artifact layout below
`artifacts/tmp`, missing supported-handoff failure, and secret-like metadata
redaction or rejection. Passing this helper dry-run proves only that existing
compiler tools can materialize the selected-boundary/emission-plan surface,
export the bounded manifest handoff, and export deterministic standalone C
source. It is not RVV runtime, correctness, generic lowering, runtime ABI, or
performance evidence.
