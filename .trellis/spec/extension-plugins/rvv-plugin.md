# RVV Plugin

## Role

RVV is the current primary real-hardware plugin for TianChen-RV. It is the
first family that must become route-supported, typed, plugin-owned, and backed
by `ssh rvv` evidence whenever runtime, correctness, or performance is claimed.

RVV-first does not mean an `i32m1` add/sub/mul demo, a current Linalg frontend
phase, one op per intrinsic, or an EmitC scheduling trick. The durable path is:

```text
tcrv.exec envelope
  -> selected RVV variant
  -> typed low-level tcrv_rvv vector-level body
  -> RVV plugin-owned legality / selected-body realization / route provider
  -> TCRVEmitCLowerableRoute
  -> common EmitC materializer
  -> RVV intrinsic C/C++ or equivalent backend representation
  -> target artifact
  -> ssh rvv evidence when runtime/correctness/performance is claimed
```

## Authority Placement

### `tcrv.exec`

`tcrv.exec` owns execution envelope and organization only:

```text
kernel
capability scope
selected variants
requires
dispatch / fallback
diagnostics
mem_window / runtime_param ABI role declarations
```

It does not own RVV compute semantics, dtype authority, RVV schedule,
intrinsic spelling, or selected route authority. A route id, artifact name,
C ABI string, test name, source-front-door marker, descriptor, or diagnostic
status must not be used to infer RVV computation.

### `tcrv_rvv` Body

The selected `tcrv_rvv` body owns typed vector-level RVV execution structure:

```text
typed vector values
element dtype
SEW / LMUL / vtype policy constraints
VL / AVL / setvl
load/store and memory forms
arithmetic / compare / select / FMA
reduction primitive / accumulator
mask / tail behavior
movement / layout / conversion
runtime ABI value use
low-level vector control
```

The desired generic typed shape is:

```text
!tcrv_rvv.vector<elem = i32, lmul = m1>
%vl = tcrv_rvv.setvl %remaining {sew = 32, lmul = m1, policy = ...}
%a  = tcrv_rvv.load %lhs[%i], %vl
%b  = tcrv_rvv.load %rhs[%i], %vl
%c  = tcrv_rvv.binary {kind = add} %a, %b, %vl
tcrv_rvv.store %out[%i], %c, %vl
```

Dtype/config/operation facts enter through typed values, config, and body
structure. Do not infer them from route ids, C ABI strings, parameter names,
artifact names, test names, exact `__riscv_*_i32m1` spellings, or old
`!tcrv_rvv.i32m1` helper names.

The RVV route provider derives concrete intrinsic/backend spelling from:

```text
operation kind
element type
SEW
LMUL
tail/mask policy
operand form
memory form
runtime ABI binding
target capability
```

### RVV Plugin

The RVV plugin owns:

- legality for RVV body/config/control/dataflow;
- selected-body realization when hints/config/profile affect generated code;
- route support and route provider output;
- intrinsic mapping;
- C/RVV vector type mapping;
- ABI mapping;
- fail-closed diagnostics.

Common/core orchestration may call plugin interfaces and validate generic
structure. It must not branch on RVV semantics, choose RVV intrinsics, infer
dtype, build schedules, or synthesize body shape.

### Common EmitC / Export

Common EmitC/export owns neutral materialization and packaging only. It
materializes provider-built `TCRVEmitCLowerableRoute` payloads. It must not
invent RVV compute, dtype, SEW/LMUL, schedule, intrinsic choices, or ABI role
semantics.

## Parameter Flow

`tcrv.exec.mem_window` and `tcrv.exec.runtime_param` declare ABI/runtime roles:

```text
lhs / rhs / out / n
buffer / scalar
input / output
runtime count
C ABI spelling / provenance
```

The selected `tcrv_rvv` body must explicitly bind/import those values and
consume them in typed control/dataflow:

```text
%lhs = tcrv_rvv.runtime_abi_value @lhs
%rhs = tcrv_rvv.runtime_abi_value @rhs
%out = tcrv_rvv.runtime_abi_value @out
%n   = tcrv_rvv.runtime_abi_value @n
```

Then the body uses them through `setvl`, loads/stores, compute ops, masks,
reductions, or movement ops. `tcrv.exec` must not infer add/mul/reduce/dtype
from ABI role names, C type strings, or artifact metadata.

## Stage Gates

### Stage 1: RVV Route-Authority Reset

Stage 1 replaces or fail-closes active paths that still treat any of these as
RVV architecture authority:

```text
bounded i32m1 arithmetic
RVVI32M1 route specs/slices
finite tcrv_rvv.i32_* ops
!tcrv_rvv.i32m1 helper types
rvv-i32m1 route ids
artifact names
source-front-door / source-artifact markers
descriptor residue
exact __riscv_*_i32m1 spellings
```

Stage 1 ends only when no active compiler path uses those as the RVV family
architecture. Do not preserve a supported legacy `rvv-i32m1-*` object/header
or bundle compatibility route. Do not add new dtype-prefixed helper families
such as reduction, accumulator, multiply-accumulate, conversion, memory-form,
or LMUL clones.

Legacy explicit bodies may remain only as parse/verify/fail-closed fixtures,
or be rewritten as ordinary instances of the corrected generic typed vector
surface. They must not be positive generated-artifact tests unless rewritten
onto the corrected typed route.

### Stage 2: Corrected Typed RVV Coverage

Stage 2 expands route-supported RVV coverage on the corrected typed
`tcrv_rvv` surface. Coverage is calibrated by Linalg-like structured
computation classes:

```text
elementwise
broadcast
reduction / accumulation
contraction-like accumulation
memory movement
dtype conversion
mask / tail
runtime shape/control
layout / movement
```

This is not permission to build a current Linalg frontend, high-level kernel
ops, one-intrinsic wrappers, dtype/LMUL clone batches, global autotuning
databases, dashboards, or readiness state machines.

### Stage 2 Performance Layer

RVV plugin-local selected-body realization is one linear compiler step:

```text
selected pre-realized tcrv_rvv body
  + target capability
  + runtime SSA / ABI values
  + optional hints / policy / profile
    -> realized tcrv_rvv selected body
    -> faithful EmitC / intrinsic lowering
```

Hints/config/profile are not final products. If they affect generated code,
the RVV plugin must consume them into real `tcrv_rvv` structure:

```text
dynamic VL/setvl placement
legal SEW/LMUL/policy
memory forms
mask/tail materialization
register-pressure-safe unroll
prefetch/software-pipeline structure
accumulator/reduction layout
```

### Stage 3: Other Families After RVV Maturity

IME, Offload, TensorExtLite, Template/Toy source-front-door examples, and
future plugin workflows are Stage3/later unless an explicit task says
otherwise. They must not displace Stage1/Stage2 RVV work.

## `with_vl` Boundary

`tcrv_rvv.with_vl` may remain a structural control boundary for VL-scoped RVV
body regions. Its selected-boundary attrs are legacy diagnostic mirrors only.
A mature RVV route must be recognized from typed body structure and
plugin-owned legality/realization, not from `status`, route mapping attrs,
artifact ids, or conformance labels on `with_vl`.

Good:

```text
typed body structure + plugin legality -> provider-built route
```

Bad:

```text
with_vl status/route attr -> route authority
```

## Source Front Doors

Source-front-door and source-artifact bundle pipelines are disabled by default
for current RVV Stage 1. A source-only RVV marker must fail closed unless an
explicit future task enables an opt-in path after mature typed body routes
exist.

No Stage1 spec or test may require positive RVV artifact generation from
source-front-door/source-artifact metadata. Positive RVV generated artifacts
must come from corrected typed `tcrv_rvv` bodies and plugin-built routes.

## Route-Family Owner Boundaries

When several active selected-body routes have been closed as one RVV
route-family cluster, the family ownership boundary should be explicit in
RVV planning/provider code rather than recreated as a manual list in the
central provider path.

For a family cluster, the planning-owned owner surface should expose:

```text
family name
consumer predicate over RVVSelectedBodyOperationKind
provider-plan verifier over RVVSelectedBodyRouteAnalysis
```

The production provider should consume an aggregate owner verifier for that
cluster. The aggregate verifier dispatches to each registered owner and must
fail closed when:

- a route-family consumer is missing its validated family plan;
- a non-consumer carries a stale family plan;
- route description mirrors, runtime ABI parameters, intrinsic/type/header
  mirrors, or `RouteOperandBindingPlan` closure no longer match the validated
  plan.

When multiple cluster or standalone family verifier boundaries are active, the
production selected-body RVV provider should consume one top-level owner
registry rather than manually sequencing verifier calls in the provider body.
That top-level registry is still dispatch structure only. Its durable API
shape is:

```text
getRVVSelectedBodyRouteFamilyProviderOwners()
isRVVSelectedBodyRouteFamilyProviderConsumer(RVVSelectedBodyOperationKind)
verifyRVVSelectedBodyRouteFamilyProviderPlans(RVVSelectedBodyRouteAnalysis, context)
```

Each top-level owner entry exposes the same contract as a cluster owner:
family name, consumer predicate, and provider-plan verifier. Entries may point
to aggregate cluster verifiers, such as memory or elementwise/select, or to a
standalone mature family verifier, such as runtime scalar splat-store or
widening conversion. The top-level verifier must preserve the underlying
missing-plan, stale-plan, mirror, runtime ABI, and binding-closure diagnostics;
it must not replace sub-family verification or merge family semantics.

The registry is dispatch/locality structure only. It must not merge family
semantics: mask producer/source facts, segment field roles, stride/index facts,
inactive-lane contracts, dtype/config facts, runtime ABI order, and intrinsic
mapping remain in the owning RVV family plan and verifier. Common EmitC and
target export may consume mirrors after route construction, but they must not
own the route-family registry or infer RVV semantics from it.

Required tests for a new or changed owner registry:

- C++ tests for registry membership, owner names, consumer classification,
  missing-plan diagnostics, stale-plan diagnostics, and aggregate verifier
  dispatch;
- for a top-level provider owner registry, C++ tests must also prove that
  production-owned entries include every active aggregate or standalone
  provider verifier boundary and that production construction calls the
  top-level aggregate verifier;
- representative lit/FileCheck coverage showing existing explicit or
  pre-realized selected-body artifacts still flow from typed `tcrv_rvv` bodies;
- at least one fail-closed typed-body mismatch diagnostic before
  materialization;
- runtime `ssh rvv` evidence only when emitted target sequence, ABI, or
  materialized operands changed.

## Route Materialization Facts Boundary

### 1. Scope / Trigger

After the top-level route-family provider verifier accepts a selected-body
analysis, RVV provider construction must obtain route materialization facts
from one RVV-owned boundary instead of recreating family-specific type,
header, intrinsic, mask/VL, and route-shape choices in the central provider
prelude.

### 2. Signatures

The durable planning/provider API is:

```c++
llvm::Expected<RVVSelectedBodyRouteMaterializationFacts>
getRVVSelectedBodyRouteMaterializationFacts(
    const RVVSelectedBodyRouteAnalysis &analysis, llvm::StringRef context);
```

`RVVEmitCRouteProvider` must call
`verifyRVVSelectedBodyRouteFamilyProviderPlans(analysis, context)` before
consuming these facts.

### 3. Contracts

`RVVSelectedBodyRouteMaterializationFacts` is RVV-local provider input. It may
carry:

- pointers to the validated family plans present in
  `RVVSelectedBodyRouteAnalysis`;
- route-shape booleans derived from those plans, such as widening conversion,
  contraction dot reduction, computed-mask accumulation, and standalone
  reduction;
- provider-owned required headers;
- VL/result/source/mask type names and C type strings;
- selected `setvl`, load, store, compute, compare, merge, splat, widening, and
  source-load intrinsic leaves.

These facts are consumed to build `TCRVEmitCLowerableRoute`. They are not
common EmitC facts, not artifact metadata authority, and not acceptance state.
They must remain derived from verified typed body/config/runtime facts and
their owning family plans.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Top-level verifier rejects missing plan for a route-family consumer ->
  materialization facts must not be consumed.
- Top-level verifier rejects stale plan on a non-consumer -> materialization
  facts must not be consumed.
- A route requiring computed-mask accumulation has no shared accumulation plan
  -> `getRVVSelectedBodyRouteMaterializationFacts` fails closed before
  provider materialization.
- Mirrors, route ids, artifact names, or status fields disagree with the
  verified family plan -> provider verification fails before common EmitC.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: typed `tcrv_rvv` body -> family plan verifier -> materialization facts
  -> provider-built `TCRVEmitCLowerableRoute`.
- Base: ordinary elementwise or memory route uses description/default facts
  only when no more-specific family plan owns that fact.
- Bad: central provider code manually chooses RVV C types or intrinsics from
  operation names, route ids, artifacts, status fields, or common EmitC logic.

### 6. Tests Required

- C++ tests for representative materialization facts across memory,
  elementwise/select, math, runtime scalar splat-store, and widening conversion
  families.
- C++ fail-closed diagnostic for a computed-mask accumulation route without
  the required shared accumulation plan.
- Representative lit/FileCheck coverage proving existing selected-body
  artifact materialization still passes.
- Active-authority scan over touched RVV planning/provider/test files for
  legacy i32/source-front-door/descriptor/mirror-only authority drift.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

Wrong:

```text
provider prelude:
  if operation is memory/select/math/... choose headers/types/intrinsics here
```

Correct:

```text
verified route-family plans
  -> RVVSelectedBodyRouteMaterializationFacts
  -> provider-built TCRVEmitCLowerableRoute
```

## Emission Diagnostics And Artifacts

Emission-plan diagnostics, route ids, artifact metadata, manifests, and
generated filenames are exact mirrors after route construction. They are not
authority for route support, dtype, compute, schedule, body shape, correctness,
runtime, performance, or progress.

Target artifact export is valid only after:

1. Selected RVV variant exists.
2. Typed/realized `tcrv_rvv` body exists.
3. RVV plugin legality accepts the body.
4. RVV route provider returns a `TCRVEmitCLowerableRoute`.
5. Common EmitC materializes that route faithfully.
6. Target export packages the materialized output with metadata as mirrors.

Runtime, correctness, or performance claims additionally require real
`ssh rvv` evidence.

## Fail-Closed Legacy Inventory

The following names may appear in tests/specs only as deprecated/fail-closed
inventory or historical residue:

```text
RVVI32M1ArithmeticRouteSpec
RVVI32M1ArithmeticSlice
collectRVVI32M1ArithmeticSlice
rvv-i32m1-arithmetic-emitc-route-family
rvv-i32m1-{add,sub,mul,cmp-select}-callable-c-abi.v1
tcrv_rvv.i32_load
tcrv_rvv.i32_broadcast_load
tcrv_rvv.i32_add
tcrv_rvv.i32_sub
tcrv_rvv.i32_mul
tcrv_rvv.i32_cmp_eq
tcrv_rvv.i32_select
tcrv_rvv.i32_store
!tcrv_rvv.i32m1
__riscv_*_i32m1
```

Safe use:

- negative tests proving these paths fail closed;
- parser/verifier fixtures that do not generate artifacts;
- migration notes pointing to deletion/rewrite;
- historical comments explaining why they are not architecture authority.

Unsafe use:

- supported object/header/bundle plans;
- positive generated-artifact tests;
- compatibility routes;
- route-provider inputs;
- dtype propagation;
- route ids or artifact names used as compute authority.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Does the selected RVV path start from `tcrv.exec` envelope plus selected RVV variant?
- [ ] Does the variant contain or reference a typed low-level `tcrv_rvv` body?
- [ ] Are dtype/config/operation facts structural in the typed or realized body?
- [ ] Are ABI roles declared in `tcrv.exec` and explicitly consumed in the body?
- [ ] Does RVV plugin legality run before route construction?
- [ ] Does selected-body realization consume any code-affecting hints/config into body structure?
- [ ] Does the route provider build `TCRVEmitCLowerableRoute`?
- [ ] Does common EmitC only materialize provider output?
- [ ] Are source-front-door and legacy i32m1 paths fail-closed by default?
- [ ] Are emission diagnostics and artifacts mirrors only?
- [ ] Is `ssh rvv` evidence present for any runtime/correctness/performance claim?
