# Emission Runtime Contract

## Core Principle

Core pass does not implement extension-specific emission. Each plugin owns its lowering/emission/runtime glue.

Variant selection and emission path must be represented in capability model and verified before final lowering.

## Emission Readiness First Slice

The first compiler-visible emission slice is a target-neutral readiness check.
It does not lower IR, generate runtime ABI glue, invoke a toolchain, run a
kernel, or prove correctness/performance. It verifies that current
`tcrv.exec` structure can be routed to the origin plugin that owns each
materialized variant.

Rules:

- route by the materialized `tcrv.exec.variant` `origin` attribute;
- carry the variant, enclosing `tcrv.exec.kernel`, generic
  `TargetCapabilitySet`, and target-neutral role (`direct variant`,
  `dispatch case`, or `dispatch fallback`);
- require supported plugin results to contain a non-empty plugin-owned emission
  path identifier or description;
- require unsupported plugin results to contain a non-empty reason;
- diagnose missing/empty origin, unknown plugin, disabled plugin, malformed
  plugin result, missing kernel/variant, and non-direct variant/kernel
  relationships generically;
- validate `tcrv.exec.dispatch` case/fallback targets structurally before
  routing to plugins: every reference must resolve to a direct sibling
  `tcrv.exec.variant` in the same kernel and duplicate references are invalid;
- when no dispatch is present, consume a direct selected-path
  `tcrv.exec.diagnostic` marker before falling back to all variants; the marker
  must carry a direct sibling variant `target` and a generic `selection_kind`
  such as `static-variant` or `fallback-only`;
- avoid core branches on RVV, IME, offload, scalar, vendor, dtype, shape,
  runtime, toolchain, or microarchitecture details.

## Emission Plan First Slice

After readiness and selected-path traversal, the compiler may collect
plugin-owned emission plans. An emission plan is a target-neutral compiler
decision object, not an executable artifact.

Rules:

- route by the same materialized variant `origin` plugin as readiness;
- carry kernel symbol, variant symbol, selected-path role, support status,
  origin plugin, and diagnostic/explanation metadata;
- for supported paths, require non-empty emission kind, lowering pipeline
  identifier, runtime ABI identifier, artifact kind, and explanation;
- for unsupported paths, require a non-empty diagnostic reason;
- diagnose missing origin, unregistered origin, disabled origin plugin,
  malformed plugin result, mismatched variant symbol, mismatched kernel symbol,
  mismatched selected-path role, duplicate selected markers, and missing
  dispatch targets generically before treating the plan as usable;
- allow public tools to populate a deterministic built-in plugin registry before
  constructing registry-dependent passes, while keeping the traversal and
  selected-path routing target-neutral in shared pass code;
- keep the boundary clear: readiness says whether a selected path is
  supportable, while the plan describes the plugin-owned lowering/runtime route
  or the structured unsupported reason;
- do not claim generated code, runtime ABI glue, linked artifacts, RVV hardware
  execution, correctness, or performance from an emission plan alone.

## RVV Lowering Boundary First Slice

Before executable RVV lowering exists, the RVV plugin may materialize a
plugin-local `tcrv_rvv.lowering_boundary` operation for selected RVV direct
variants or dispatch cases. This operation is an extension-dialect attachment
point for future lowering work, not an executable lowering product.

Rules:

- materialization consumes selected `tcrv.exec` dispatch or selected-marker
  structure and generic variant `origin` metadata;
- RVV ownership and legality are routed through the `ExtensionPluginRegistry`
  and RVV plugin before the boundary op is created;
- scalar or other fallback references remain `tcrv.exec.fallback` metadata and
  do not receive RVV lowering-boundary ops;
- the boundary op must carry `status = "unsupported"` and a non-empty
  unsupported reason;
- the boundary op must not claim RVV intrinsics, LLVM/RISC-V lowering, runtime
  ABI glue, generated objects, hardware execution, correctness, or performance.

## EmissionProvider Responsibilities

Each plugin emission provider:

- registers lowering patterns;
- declares emission path;
- declares compiler flags, headers, libraries;
- generates runtime glue;
- reports unsupported path;
- emits diagnostics.

## RVV Emission

### MLIR vector / LLVM scalable vector

Path:

```text
tcrv.rvv ops
  -> MLIR vector dialect / LLVM dialect
  -> LLVM scalable vector
  -> LLVM RISC-V backend
  -> RVV machine code
```

Use for ordinary arithmetic, load/store, and reductions that LLVM reliably lowers.

### RVV intrinsic / inline asm / builtin

Path:

```text
tcrv.rvv ops
  -> LLVM RVV intrinsic / compiler builtin / inline asm
  -> native compile
```

Use for precise `vsetvl`, mask/tail policy, segment/strided ops, or key kernels where LLVM vector lowering is not stable enough.

## IME Emission

Possible paths:

```text
vendor intrinsic
compiler builtin
inline asm
external assembly stub
patched LLVM/backend adapter
```

Rules:

- IME-specific emission stays inside IME plugin.
- Core only knows that the variant has an emission path.
- Capability model records toolchain support.
- If emission is unavailable, verifier rejects the variant or preserves it as disabled diagnostic.

## Offload Emission

Offload emission is runtime glue generation, not instruction generation.

Path:

```text
tcrv.offload ops
  -> C ABI call / vendor runtime call
  -> link vendor runtime library
  -> runtime dispatch / sync / buffer management
```

Generated or declared runtime pieces:

- runtime handle initialization;
- buffer binding/allocation;
- host-device copy;
- async call;
- wait/sync;
- error handling;
- resource release;
- fallback path.

## Runtime Dispatch Lowering

`tcrv.exec.dispatch` lowers to host-side decision logic.

Inputs:

```text
capability availability
runtime probe
shape/dtype guard
cost threshold
user policy
```

Output:

```text
call selected variant or fallback
```

Dispatch logic must diagnose why a variant was selected or skipped.

## Fallback Lowering

Fallback is required for system completeness. Sources may include:

```text
MLIR default lowering
scalar/scf lowering
LLVM auto-vectorization
portable C/C++ kernel
RVV conservative kernel
```

Fallback targets correctness and coverage, not the main performance story.

## Toolchain Boundary

Rules:

- plugin declares toolchain requirement;
- capability verifier checks the requirement;
- core pass does not call vendor-specific compiler path directly;
- build system selects flags/libraries through plugin metadata;
- unsupported path produces clear diagnostics.

## Deployment Profiles

Reference profiles:

```text
rvv-native
  target: ssh rvv
  emission: LLVM/RVV intrinsic/native compile
  runtime: OpenMP/pthread optional

k3-ime
  target: K3/IME environment
  emission: IME plugin selected path
  runtime: native or vendor support

riscv-sophgo-offload
  target: RISC-V host + Sophgo runtime
  emission: C ABI/runtime glue
  runtime: vendor accelerator runtime
```

## Reproducibility Output

Each emission path should record:

- selected variant;
- required capabilities;
- selected compiler flags;
- selected runtime libraries;
- lowering path;
- fallback status;
- unsupported reason if failed.

Before real lowering/runtime work exists, plugin emission plans may be
materialized as `tcrv.exec.diagnostic {reason = "emission_plan"}` metadata.
These diagnostics are reproducibility and compiler-decision records only. A
supported or metadata-only diagnostic records plugin-owned intent such as
emission kind, lowering pipeline id, runtime ABI id, and artifact kind; it does
not mean that the compiler emitted LLVM/RISC-V/RVV IR, assembled an object,
linked a runtime, ran hardware, proved correctness, or measured performance.
Unsupported diagnostics should carry explicit plugin diagnostic text and are
valid evidence of a boundary, not of executable support.

The current public `tcrv-opt` built-in registry includes the RVV first-slice
plugin. Therefore an `origin = "rvv-plugin"` selected path can materialize an
unsupported plugin-owned emission-plan diagnostic instead of a generic
unregistered-origin failure. This remains compiler metadata only and must not be
reported as RVV lowering, runtime, correctness, or performance evidence. The
tool-level `--tcrv-disable-builtin-plugins` option preserves an explicit
empty-registry surface for negative parser/diagnostic tests.

The `tcrv_rvv.lowering_boundary` first slice is one step more concrete than an
emission-plan diagnostic because it is an RVV extension-dialect op, but it is
still pre-executable and unsupported. It is valid evidence that selected-path
metadata reached a plugin-local RVV boundary. It is not evidence that the
compiler emitted LLVM/RISC-V/RVV IR, assembled an object, linked runtime glue,
ran hardware, proved correctness, or measured performance.

## RVV Probe Evidence Boundary

`scripts/rvv_remote_probe.py` may produce `ssh rvv` evidence under
`artifacts/tmp/rvv_probe/<run-id>/`. That artifact is a remote
hardware/toolchain evidence record, not an emission artifact. Even when its
minimal hand-written RVV intrinsic program compiles and runs, the result only
proves that the remote host can compile and execute that probe program.

Do not reinterpret an RVV probe artifact as:

- plugin-supported emission readiness;
- compiler lowering to LLVM, RISC-V, or RVV intrinsics;
- generated object, executable, runtime ABI glue, or dispatch lowering;
- TianChen-RV compiler correctness;
- RVV kernel performance.

Future supported RVV emission must add plugin-local lowering/runtime work and
then cite both compiler-generated artifact evidence and separate `ssh rvv`
hardware/toolchain evidence.

## Scalar Fallback Metadata Boundary

The first scalar fallback plugin slice may return a metadata-only emission
readiness result and materialize a metadata-only emission-plan diagnostic for
the portable fallback route:

```text
status: metadata-only
emission kind: portable-scalar-fallback-metadata-route
lowering pipeline: none-executable-metadata-only
runtime ABI: none-metadata-only
artifact kind: metadata-diagnostic
```

This is still compiler-decision metadata. It does not prove that TianChen-RV
emitted LLVM IR, generated an object, linked a runtime, executed a scalar
kernel, proved correctness, or measured performance. Later scalar fallback
lowering must add plugin-local lowering code and validation artifacts before
reporting executable support.
