## Session 339: Stage2 RVV contraction selected-body handoff closure

**Date**: 2026-05-30
**Task**: Stage2 RVV contraction selected-body handoff closure
**Branch**: `main`

### Summary

Moved pre-realized widening contraction validation into the contraction route-family owner, kept selected-body realization as dispatcher/construction only, archived the task, and validated with RVV focused tests, generated-bundle dry-runs, MAcc non-regression, and check-tianchenrv 464/464.

## Session 340: Stage2 RVV base-memory selected-body handoff closure

**Date**: 2026-05-30
**Task**: Stage2 RVV base-memory selected-body provider handoff closure
**Branch**: `main`

### Summary

Moved base-memory pre-realized selected-body validation authority for strided
load/store, indexed gather/scatter, and static-mask load/store into
`RVVEmitCBaseMemoryRouteFamilyPlanOwners`. `RVVSelectedBodyRealization.cpp`
now delegates validation through owner-local APIs and retains selected-body
dispatch plus realized IR materialization.

### Main Changes

- Added owner-local selected-body validation declarations and definitions for
  the five base-memory pre-realized body ops.
- Removed central base-memory validation helper ownership from
  `RVVSelectedBodyRealization.cpp`.
- Added focused C++ coverage proving selected-boundary production code can call
  owner-local base-memory validation.

### Git Commits

### Testing

- [OK] `git diff --check`
- [OK] `ninja -C build tianchenrv-rvv-extension-plugin-test`
- [OK] `build/bin/tianchenrv-rvv-extension-plugin-test`
- [OK] Base-memory generated-bundle dry-run for all six affected variants.
- [OK] Direct route-entry negative dry-run failed closed with the expected
  retired-shortcut diagnostic.
- [OK] Contraction generated-bundle dry-run non-regression.
- [OK] `ninja -C build check-tianchenrv` passed 464/464 tests.

### Status

[OK] **Completed**
